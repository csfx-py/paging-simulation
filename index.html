      <h1>Paging</h1>
      <p>
        Paging is a function of memory management where a computer will store
        and retrieve data from a device's secondary storage (hard disk, SSD) to
        the primary storage (RAM). Memory management is a crucial aspect of any
        computing device, and paging specifically is important to the
        implementation of virtual memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Virtual memory, what paging is used for often, is a memory management
        technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the
        main memory. Paging acts as an important part of virtual memory, as it
        allows programs in secondary storage to exceed the available size of the
        physical storage.
      </p>
      <h1>Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems</h1>
      <p>
        In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page
        replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be
        replaced when new page comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Page Fault-</span>A page fault happens when a running program
        accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space,
        but not loaded in physical memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since actual physical memory is much smaller than virtual memory, page
        faults happen. In case of page fault, Operating System might have to
        replace one of the existing pages with the newly needed page. Different
        page replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page
        to replace. The target for all algorithms is to reduce the number of
        page faults.
      </p>
      <h3>Page Replacement Algorithms:</h3>
      <h4>1. First In First Out</h4>
      <p>
        This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the
        operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the
        oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be
        replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span>Consider page reference string 1, 3, 0, 3, 5, 6
        with 3 page frames.Find number of page faults.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially all slots are empty, so when 1, 3, 0 came they are allocated
        to the empty slots —><span> 3 Page Faults. </span><br />
        when 3 comes, it is already in memory so —> 0 Page Faults. <br />
        Then 5 comes, it is not available in memory so it replaces the oldest
        page slot i.e 1. —>1 Page Fault. <br />
        6 comes, it is also not available in memory so it replaces the oldest
        page slot i.e 3 —>1 Page Fault. <br />
        Finally when 3 come it is not available so it replaces 0 1 page fault
      </p>
      <h3>2. Least Recently Used</h3>
      <p>
        In this algorithm page will be replaced which is least recently used.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span>Consider the page references 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0,
        4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, with 4 page frame. Find number of page fault.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the
        empty slots —><span>4 Page faults</span><br />
        0 is already there so —> <span>0 Page fault.</span><br />
        when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is least recently
        used —><span>1 Page fault</span><br />Now for the further page reference
        string —> <span>0 Page fault</span><br />
        because they are already available in the memory.
      </p>
